\title{Extract cross sections and bankfull width (parallel)}
\usage{
extract_xs_wbf(cross_section, depth, hpc = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cross_section}{output from bisect_line_segments()}

\item{depth}{bathymetry raster}

\item{hpc}{flag for "high performance computing"}
}
\description{
Extracts cross sections and bankfull width in parallel
}
\details{
This is the same as extract_wbf, except that it also outputs the transects
and has some error catches.
Extracts data underlying the lines in cross_section.
Uses first and last overlapped pixels to estimate bankfull width from 
perpendicular bisectors to the river centerline.

\examples{
wbfs_and_mc <- extract_xs_wbf(cross_section, depth, hpc = TRUE)
wbfs_and_mc <- extract_xs_wbf(cross_section[1:10], depth, hpc = TRUE)
}

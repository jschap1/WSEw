# WSEw

R package for analyzing water surface elevation (WSE) - width (w). Includes routines for processing 2D bathymetry data into 1D cross sections, fitting height-width models to WSE-w data, and using these models to predict bathymetry.

Specifically, there are four height-width models implemented:
* Linear
* Piecewise linear (slope break)
* Nonlinear (hydraulic geometry-based)
* Piecewise nonlinear

The methodology builds upon Mersel et al. (2013)'s "slope break" method presented in Water Resources Research.
